          <p>So you'd like to test you knowledge on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Well, you've come to the right place!
            In this quiz, you'll be asked a short series of questions that are based on what you may have learned thus
            far. These are all multiple choice questions, and you'll have one minute to answer each. But be careful, 
            if you select an incorrect answer, 20 seconds will be deducted from the timer! So think hard, and try to
            avoid guessing! <strong>Good luck!</strong>
